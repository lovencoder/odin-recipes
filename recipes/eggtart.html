        <p class="para"> A freshly baked egg tart invites you with the gentle perfume of sweet custard and buttery pastry drifting through the air. As you lift it in your hand, the golden, flaky crust feels delicate and crisp, its thin layers whispering with the slightest touch. The smooth custard gleams softly in the center, a silky pool of sunshine-yellow warmth that shivers slightly when moved, promising softness and comfort in every bite.</p>
        <p class="para">The first taste is a quiet symphony of textures and flavors. Your teeth meet the crisp, crumbly pastry that melts almost instantly, giving way to the velvety custard beneath. It's warm, creamy, and subtly sweet, with soft notes of vanilla and egg that glide across your tongue. A gentle hint of caramelization from the baked surface adds depth, balancing the richness with a whisper of toasted sweetness. Each bite leaves behind a comforting warmth and a lingering sweetness—light, elegant, and utterly satisfying.</p>

        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar and flour. Mix in butter with a fork until it is in small crumbs. Stir in the egg and vanilla until the mixture forms a dough. The texture should be slightly moist. Add more butter if it is too dry, or more flour, if the dough seems greasy. Shape dough into 1 1/2 inch balls, and press the balls into tart molds so that it covers the bottom, and goes up higher than the sides. Use 2 fingers to shape the edge into an A shape.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine the white sugar and water in a medium saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sugar is dissolved, remove from heat and cool to room temperature. Strain the eggs through a sieve, and whisk into the sugar mixture. Stir in the evaporated milk and vanilla. Strain the filling through a sieve, and fill the tart shells.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown, and the filling is puffed up a little bit.</li>
